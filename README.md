# 3D-Renderer
This is a 3D renderer made as a Linear Algebra project, to show how linear transformations are used to transform 3D points into 2D points to be able to show 3D images and objects as a 2D one. Also shows how vectors and operations like dot and cross product are used to simulate ligting in a 3D enviroment.

This proyect is made with Python, and uses pygame to draw 2D graphics (points, lines and polygons) into the screen.

The 3D part, and the matrix and vector operations are coded form scratch.
